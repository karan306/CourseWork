Task 1:

1 Hidden layer with 10 nodes
Output layer with 2 nodes
Learning rate = 0.1
Batch Size = 20
Number of epochs = 20
Seed =7

With 5&6 nodes in hidden layer , with some seeds the accuracy was lower than 90%. So I have used 10 nodes for hidden layer.
As the data is not linearly separable we cannot do with 1 node in hidden layer
/*********
nn1 = nn.NeuralNetwork(2, 0.1, 20, 20)
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(2,10))
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(10,2))
**********/

Task 3:

1 Hidden layer with 20 nodes
Output layer with 10 nodes
Learning rate = 0.1
Batch Size = 10
Number of epochs = 5
Seed = 7

With small number of nodes the validation accuracy was not well above 90. So used 20 nodes
As the data is not linearly separable we cannot do with 1 node in hidden layer
/*********
nn1 = nn.NeuralNetwork(10, 0.1, 10, 5)
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(784,20))
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(20,10))
**********/

Task 4:

1 ConvolutionLayer with 32 filters of size 3x10x10 and stride 2
1 AvgPoolingLayer with stride 4 and input 32x12x12
1 FlattenLayer to flatten the nodes in the AvgPoolingLayer
1 Hidden FullyConnectedLayer with 288 nodes
Output Layer with 10
Learning rate = 0.1
Batch Size = 20
Number of epochs = 20
Seed = 12

With small layers, the validation accuracy was sometimes decreasing with epochs
/*********
nn1 = nn.NeuralNetwork(10, 0.1, 20, 20)
nn1.addLayer(ConvolutionLayer([3,32,32], [10,10], 32, 2))
nn1.addLayer(AvgPoolingLayer([32,12,12], [4,4], 4))
nn1.addLayer(FlattenLayer())
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(288,100))
nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(100,10))
