1. These 2 lines are basically adding the page referenced by the address v to the freelist by making it the head of the freelist.
 The line "r->next = kmem.freelist;" gets the pointer to the freelist and saves it into r->next.
 The next line now updates the freelist pointer to r. Note that r->next contains the pointer to the original freelist.

2. The first line gets the physical address of the page table corresponding to the given va.
The second line gets virtual address of the page table and typecasts it into pointer of type pte_t which is the return type of the function.
The third line gets the reference to the page table entry corresponding to the given va and returns it.
