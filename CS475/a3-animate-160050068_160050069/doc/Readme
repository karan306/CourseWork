For Human Character :-

        0 -> move the neck
        1 -> move the lower right hand
        2 -> move the upper right hand
        3 -> move the upper left hand 
        4 -> move the lower left hand
        5 -> move the abdomen
        6 -> move the upper left leg
        7 -> move the lower left leg
        8 -> move the upper right leg
        9 -> move the lower right leg

        For all the nodes 
        => left-right for rotation about y axis
        => up-down for rotation about x axis
        => PgUp-PgDn for rotation about z axis

	=> F,U,I - incraese tx ty tz respectively
	=> G,H,J - DECREASE tx ty tz respectively

        For nodes with one degree of freedom like knee and elbow

        for elbow use PgUp and PgDn for one degree of freedom
        for knee use use left-right arrow key for the one degree of freedom

        At some places like necks restict the movement to avoid detaching the part from the main body.

        abdomen is the main parent of the entire humanoid so use keys to change to abdomen
        and then rotate the abdomen for global rotation of the humanoid. 



For Teddy Bear

        0 -> move the stomach
        1 ->  move the right hand
        2 -> move the left hand
        3 -> move the right leg
        4 -> move the left leg
        5 -> move the head

        For all the nodes 
        => left-right for rotation about y axis
        => up-down for rotation about x axis
        => PgUp-PgDn for rotation about z axis

	=> F,U,I - incraese tx ty tz respectively
	=> G,H,J - DECREASE tx ty tz respectively

        Every node has 3 degree of freedom.

        stomach is the main parent of the entire teddy bear so use keys to change to stomach
        and then rotate the stomach for global rotation of the model. 


For the box 

        0 -> move the box
        1 -> move the lid

        For the box i.e. node1 
        => left-right for rotation about y axis
        => up-down for rotation about x axis
        => PgUp-PgDn for rotation about z axis

        For the lid i.e. node2

        use up-down arrow key to open or close the lid

       rotate the node1 for global rotation of the box.


ESC -> to close the window
P -> to enable or disable perspective

A,D -> for rotating the camera along y axis
W,S -> for rotating the camera along x axis
Q,E -> for rotating the camera along z axis

C,B,T - DECREASE x y z positions of camera
V,N,O - INCREASE x y z positions of camera
